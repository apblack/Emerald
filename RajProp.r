.sh 1 Research Abstract
.pp
Emerald is a new, Object-oriented distributed programming system designed
to simplify the building of distributed applications.  Local and remote
objects are semantically identical, but the compiler is able to choose the
most efficient call sequence, based on the use to which an object is put.
This grant is requested to assist in the the next phase of the Emerald
distributed system and language project, which is to evaluate the language
by using it to build a significant distributed application.  This will
enable us to determine which features of Emerald are necessary, which are
unnecessary, and which need to be optimised.
.sh 1 Deliverables
.pp
The goal of this work is to construct and demonstrate a multi-user calendar
built in Emerald, including provision for scheduling multi-person meetings
as atomic transactions.  Some refinements to the Emerald system necessary
to make the implementation realistic may also be undertaken.
.pp
To increase the value of this work to Digital, a functioning Emerald system
hosting the calendar application will be installed at Digital's Littleton
facility, for demonstration to and use by the Distributed Systems Advanced
Development Group.

.sh 1 "Background"
.pp
This project has previously received an Equipment grant from Digital
External Research, in the form of five microVAX II workstations.  The
Emerald distributed language and system is now operational on these
machines, and preliminary performance is excellent; the time taken to
perform the most general form of object invocation is (in the local case)
little more than the standard call time on a VAX.  This proposal 
is a supplement to the previous ERP proposal.
.pp
Progress of the Emerald project to date has been excellent; it has
attracted significant interest in the distributed systems community.
Two papers on Emerald have already been published [. Emerald OOPSLA,
Emerald IEEETSE .] and a third is available as a technical report [. Emerald
Mobility .].
.sh 1 "Staffing"
.pp
A qualified and suitable pre-doctoral graduate student is available to
undertake this evaluation during the summer of 1987.  However, the project
has at present no funds to support him.
.sh 1 "Funding Status"
.pp
This project has been discussed with Alan Kirby in the Distributed Systems
Advanced Development Group, who has indicated a willingness to participate.
